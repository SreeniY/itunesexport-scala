iTunesExport-Scala allows you to export playlists created in iTunes to common playlist file formats, such as m3u.

This project is a Scala port of the iTunesExport .Net application (http://www.ericdaugherty.com/dev/itunesexport/).  This version is written in Scala and compiles to Java so it can run on Mac OS X or Windows.
